<p>The Namish Kumar Programming Language is a programming language made by <b>Namish Kumar (Me) in July 2022</b>. The base language of this programming language is JavaScript. It has a simple syntax as compared to other programming languages. Starting with NKPL 2.0, you no longer need to have NodeJS installed in your system to use this language. Only download the nkpl executable file, and save it in your system path environment variable!</p>
<h1>Writing Your first NKPL program</h1>
<p>Beginners might find this language easy. To get started, Let's create a file called main.nkpl and write the following codes in it:</p>
<br>
<code>write "Hello World";</code>
<br>
<p>You'll see this write hello world in the console</p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>To install NKPL, make sure that you have installed nodejs in your system and then in a terminal window, run the following command</p>
<code>npm install -g nkpl</code>
<code>nkpl --version</code>
<p>Verify that the output is 3.6.1</p>
